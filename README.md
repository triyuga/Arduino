# Misc Arduino Tinkering

https://www.arduino.cc/

This repo is being developed using the `vscode-arduino` plugin for VS Code, which depends on the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

The `/examples` dir is pulled from the Arduino-IDE app here `/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/examples`

The `/examples.config` dir contains example config files with comments about my learnings.
